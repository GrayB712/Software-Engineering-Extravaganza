This is the read me file. This is where we will give an overview of our code for the judges.

For now, all that I want to point out is that the folder titled, "Show_Program" contains all of the code that our arduino will need. The file inside of that folder titled, "Show_Program.ino" is the main program that runs on the arduino. If we want to include libraries/modules from within the Arduino IDE, they will appear in the "Show_Program" folder.

We may also want to add a .gitignore file later, which will tell github to not backup any temporary files/logs.
